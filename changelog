    - actually fix error handling, connection errors in particular should not gum up the works now
    - switch to inotify_simple, as inotify was giving me bizarre errors in development environment
    - add support for stripping artist/title separators from RDS PS data
    - add command line arguments for config file location, verbose mode
    - fixed early "now playing not defined" warnings before metadata changes ... now we immediately read the file on startup
    - add support for non-SSL servers
    - add support for deleting now playing file after reading
    - add a version check, it looks like 3.6 is a sane minimum
    - some general cleanup
    - refactor logging
